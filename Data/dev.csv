horrible this was the worst product i have used so far they gave one year warranty and it stopped working exactly afterwards and service will take atleast 10 days and always tells us its because of tap water the filter was not working i still dont understand how it worked fine for the warranty period using same tap watertheir technician is also useless and doesnt check anything properly overall if you have bore water try this at your own risk but if you have tap water dont even dare to try,0
