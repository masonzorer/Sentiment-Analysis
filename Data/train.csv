just okay sound enthusiasts please note ive rated this product as average 3 star and i will tell you why is that the reason you usually shell out money to get premium brands is for the simple reason that they will take care of the details here is a detail that most of the people will not tell you this product has buzzing noise when its not playing in standby or low volumes and it gets pretty irritating i use for my smart tv and assuming you are not going to be in party mode always,2

wonderful 8 months after review mi tv features are quite impressive but it takes 20 to 30 sec to boot up and this is really frustrating everytime time you start tv you need to wait 30 sec to wait for actually screen i need to add 1 of the valuable point is dont look out for android based tv in low price range because yet it is not successful you will feel major lag out while running applications better way is that just go for smart tv like samsung and lg which takes hardly 2 sec to start afte,0

really nice friends i could have given 5 rating also it is just that you cant keep this in your ears for a long time after 3 hours you might have ear itching or mild pain but thats ok material is soft and easy on ears and noise cancellation is 60 to 70 percent your concentration levels like listening to music or watching tv can be high when other external sounds are lowered the best part traffic sounds are minimal,2

did not meet expectations first and foremost the quality is not good so if youre looking for something sturdy and for long term please look away secondly and more importantly the seller is the worst and so is the flipkart after sales team believe it or not i had to wait a staggering 2 months for this thing to get assembled and set up from the date of purchase first the delivery was delayed and so was the assembly then they found a part missing and hence the technician ordered for a replacement by this time 1 m,0

good choice useful product for single adult use and even for kids for school from home in todays times manual is provided for assembling and all material available nothing missing but it was a difficult task required 1 person help while assembling the holes were not as deep as the length of screws need to carefully screw one end at the same time keep other end in alignment had to unscrew multiple times to align maybe by reading my review others can avoid same problem by keeping these points in mind,0
